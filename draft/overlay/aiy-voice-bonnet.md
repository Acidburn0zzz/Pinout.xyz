# AIY Voice Bonnet

The AIY Voice Bonnet comes with the AIY Voice Kit (V2) by Googleâ€”a do-it-yourself intelligent speaker. The Voice Bonnet connects to a Raspberry Pi Zero to create a natural language processor that can connect to the Google Assistant.

The bonnet includes on-board hardware to facilitate audio capture and playback, stereo speaker terminals, a headphone jack, an 8-pin button connector, UART breakout pins, and 4 unique GPIO pins called `PIN_A`, `PIN_B`, `PIN_C`, and `PIN_D`.

If you have the V1 Voice Kit (full size HAT for Raspberry Pi 3), instead see the [Voice Hat](/pinout/aiy_voice_hat).
