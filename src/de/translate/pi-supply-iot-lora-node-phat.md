#IoT LoRa Node pHAT

Our IoT LoRa Node pHAT allows you to create an inexpensive LoRa node, compatible with The Things Network, in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi or other single board computers. This pHAT allows you to set up your IoT LoRa Node in minutes rather than hours for a third of the price of traditional gateways. Just add sensors, buttons and more to complete your LoRa network!
